# Template to Get Started
Please execute the CompareTest.java file. This can be found under src/main/java/com/service

## Versions
The latest version is **1.0**

## How To Guide
The 2 input files person.json and person.csv are present under src/main/resources
These 2 files are read inside the main function and used to create unique set of persons.
The final output is written to the uniquePerson.csv file present under src/main/output

## Testing
Test cases are written using JUnit.
I have used the personTest.csv and personTest.json which are present under src/test/resources as sample test files
PersonUtilTest.java (present in src/test/java/com/util) can be run to execute the test cases.
